This repository serves as a collection of resources to educate about the design thinking process, human-centered design, and its application in the fields of product design, UX Research, UX/UI Designer, etc. I have structured it in a way that it can be either used by newcomers to get started in this domain or by more experienced persons to just use as a reference point (although I believe there are far better resources out there for that purpose).

# Basics Of Design Thinking
This section contains resources to familiarize yourself with the design thinking process from scratch.
## An Introduction To UX Design
Watch the following videos to see what exactly is design thinking and human-centered design.

## Proceeding Further With Online Courses
If you have decided you want to delve deeper into the vast world of human-centered design after watching the above videos for a brief introduction, it is time to do a formal course on the topic. The benefit of doing a course is that it provides you with a structured learninig pathway after which you can explore further on your own. Furthermore, if it provides you with a certificate upon completion, it would also benefit you when searching for jobs in the fields of UX and UI.

1. [Google UX Design Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/ux-design-certificate?utm_source=google&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=sou--google__med--organicsearch__cam--gwgsite__con--null__ter--null)
> With a focus on digital design, this comprehensive series of courses focuses on getting the initial skills for a career in UX design. Go with this course if you want to get into a UX job.
2. [Introduction to Human-Centered Design - AcumenAcademy](https://acumenacademy.org/course/design-kit-human-centered-design/) & [Human-Centered Design 201: Prototyping - AcumenAcademy](https://acumenacademy.org/course/human-centered-design-prototyping/)
> These courses teaches human centered design more generally and do not place a focus on digital design. Go with this course if you want to learn to research and implement human centered processes in your projects.
3. [How To Start In UX](https://start.uxdesign.cc/?ref=sidebar)
> This is an excellent collection of structured resources that  offers a free, self-guided class to help you take your first steps into digital product design. It has a good mix of lessons, reading lists, watchlists, and reflections. You can use this a reference point for specific topics or follow it thoroughly.
4. [Learn UX](https://learnux.io/#courses)
> This is a collection of courses that focuses on major individual aspects of a UX job. Each courses selects a topic to cover through video lessons. You can pick and choose the topics that you feel week in after taking one of the earlier courses.

### What course should I pick?
Well, it relies on your own goals. If you want to land a job in UX, I would say go with the Google UX Design Professional Certificate as you would get a certificate upon the completing the series that *might* help you landing a job. If you want to just learn the basics of human-centered design and apply them outside of digital design, go with Acumen Academy's courses. It is a nice blend of theory and practice. Supplement whatever you choose with individual courses and chapters from How To Start In UX and Learn UX.
Ultimately, I believe that these resources all do a good enough job of getting your hands dirty by going over all the basics for the field. You can later build on the basics on your own.

## Tired Of Looking At Screens? Let's Talk About Some Books
There are a lot of good books that goes in depth about different aspects of human-centered design. But I believe that all beginners to the field should read the following.
1. [The Design Of Everyday Things - Don Norman](https://ia902800.us.archive.org/3/items/thedesignofeverydaythingsbydonnorman/The%20Design%20of%20Everyday%20Things%20by%20Don%20Norman.pdf)
2. [Don't Make Me Think - Steve Krug](https://archive.org/details/SteveKrugDontMakeMeThink/page/n37/mode/2up?view=theater)
3.

> I will be adding further resources on different UX topics, UI Designs, Portfolios, Case Studies, etc. later down the road.
