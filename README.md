This repository serves as a collection of resources to educate about the design thinking process, human-centered design, and its application in the fields of product design, UX Research, UX/UI Designer, etc. I have structured it in a way that it can be either used by newcomers to get started in this domain or by more experienced persons to just use as a reference point (although I believe there are far better resources out there for that purpose).

# Basics Of Design Thinking
This section contains resources to familiarize yourself with the design thinking process from scratch.

## Proceeding Further With Online Courses
If you have decided you want to delve deeper into this rabbit hole after watching the above videos for a brief introduction to the vast world of human-centered design and designing thinking, it is time to do a formal course on the topic. The benefit of doing a course is that it provides you with a structured learninig pathway after which you can explore further on your own. Furthermore, if it provides you with a certificate upon completion, it would also benefit you when searching for jobs in the fields of UX and UI.
